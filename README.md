# Kotlin-Learning
In this repository I will add multiple small projects were I will start with small and easy projects until I have learned the basics of Kotlin.

Below is a small desciption of the projects that will be added. The list will be updated regularly.


Coffee Machine:
This is a console application where the user can interact with a virtual coffee machine.
The user can buy 3 different types of coffee. The machine will let the user know if there is not enough resources to make te coffee.
The user can refill the resources in the machine and take out the money that is in the machine.

Parkin Lot:
This is a console application where the user can create a parking lot with the specified amount of parking spots. 
The user can park cars, the cars can leave and we can check the available parking spots.
The user can also query to get the amount of cars of a certain color or check the spot where a car with a certain registration number is parked.
